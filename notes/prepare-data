# Prepare the data – notes

Day 1 notes

---

### Excel connection (Step 1)
- Connected to sales.xlsx via Get data > Excel.
- Checked and fixed data types in Power Query.

---

### CSV connection (Step 2)
- Created and imported customers.csv via Get data > Text/CSV.
- Adjusted data types in Power Query.

---

### Step 3 – Combining multiple sources in one model

#### What I did
- Loaded `sales.xlsx` from Excel as table **sales**.
- Loaded `customers.csv` as table **customers_pl300**.
- Created a relationship:
  - customers_pl300[Region] (1-side)
  - sales[Region] (*-side)
  - Cross filter direction: Both
  - Relationship is active.
- Built a bar/column chart:
  - X-axis: **customers_pl300[Region]**
  - Y-axis: **Sum of sales[Quantity]**

#### What I noticed & fixed
- At first, every bar showed **6** (the total Quantity), no matter the region.
- This happened because there was **no active relationship** between the tables, so the Region filter didn’t reach the sales table.
- After creating the proper relationship, each region now shows its **own** Sum of Quantity.

#### What I learned
- Power BI can combine data from different sources (Excel + CSV) in one model using relationships.
- Without a relationship, filters on one table don’t affect measures from another table.
- A correct one-to-many relationship is essential for accurate visuals.

### Step 4 – Relational data sources (SQL Server)

#### What I read
- Relational data sources are databases like SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, etc.
- In Power BI I can connect to them using:
  - Server name
  - (Optional) database name
  - Credentials / authentication
- After connecting, I can select tables or write queries to load data.

#### What I did in Power BI
- Opened Get data > SQL Server in Power BI Desktop.
- Looked at the SQL Server connection dialog:
  - Server
  - Database (optional)
  - Data connectivity mode: Import or DirectQuery.
- (No real database yet, just explored the dialog.)

#### What I learned
- Relational sources are structured tables with relationships.
- Power BI connects to them via the SQL Server connector.
- I now know where to choose Import vs DirectQuery when connecting.
