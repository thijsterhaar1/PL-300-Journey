### Step 1 – Remove unnecessary columns

#### What I did in Power BI
- Reviewed each table to identify unnecessary columns:
  - Kept columns used in relationships, visuals, slicers, or measures.
  - Marked columns with constant values or not used anywhere as candidates to remove.
- In Power Query:
  - Opened **Transform data**.
  - Selected unwanted columns (e.g. Country in dim_customer, unused helper fields).
  - Used **Remove columns**.
  - Applied changes back to the model.
- Verified:
  - Removed columns no longer appear in Model/Data view.
  - Existing visuals and measures still work.

#### What I learned
- Removing unnecessary columns:
  - Reduces model size and memory usage.
  - Can improve performance (less data to scan).
  - Makes the model simpler to understand.
- Difference with hiding columns:
  - **Hide** = kolom blijft in het model (alleen niet zichtbaar in Fields → geen performance winst).
  - **Remove** = kolom echt weg uit het model → wél performance/memory winst.

### Step 2 – Disable auto date/time (or understand its impact)

#### What I did in Power BI
- Reviewed what Auto date/time does:
  - Power BI automatically creates hidden date tables for each Date/DateTime column.
  - Useful for quick time intelligence, but adds extra tables and model size.
- In the current PBIX file:
  - File → Options and settings → Options → **Current File → Data Load**
  - Turned off **Auto date/time** for this file.
- (Optional) Globally:
  - File → Options → **Global → Data Load**
  - Turned off Auto date/time for new files.

#### What I learned
- Auto date/time:
  - Creates hidden date tables behind each date column.
  - Increases model size and can be confusing when I already have a proper date table.
- With a dedicated `dim_date` marked as a Date table:
  - I don't need Auto date/time.
  - Turning it off simplifies the model and can improve performance.
- On the exam:
  - If I see a question about reducing model size or avoiding duplicate date tables,
    **disabling Auto date/time** is often the right choice (when a proper date table exists).

### Step 3 – Basics of model performance (high level)

#### What I did in Power BI
- Opened **Performance Analyzer** (View → Performance Analyzer).
- Recorded and refreshed visuals to see:
  - DAX query time
  - Visual display time
  - Other time
- Observed which visuals take the longest to render.
- Reviewed my model for common performance factors:
  - Relationship types (prefer 1:* with Single direction, avoid many-to-many/bi-directional unless necessary).
  - Columns with very high cardinality (many unique text values).
  - Complexity of DAX measures (simple aggregations vs heavy row-by-row logic).

#### What I learned
- Model performance is mainly affected by:
  - **Model size** (number of tables/columns, high-cardinality columns).
  - **Relationships and filter direction** (clean star schema is fastest).
  - **DAX complexity** (simple SUM/AVERAGE on fact tables is cheap; nested CALCULATE/FILTER/SUMX is more expensive).
  - **Visual design** (veel visuals op één pagina = meer queries).
- Performance Analyzer helps identify:
  - Which visuals/measures are slow.
  - Whether the time is in the DAX query or in visual rendering.
- High-level best practices:
  - Keep a clean **star schema** with 1:* relationships and Single direction.
  - Remove unnecessary columns/rows and avoid high-cardinality text where possible.
  - Use a proper Date table instead of multiple auto date tables.
  - Keep measures as simple as possible and reuse base measures.
