### Step 1 – Remove unnecessary columns

#### What I did in Power BI
- Reviewed each table to identify unnecessary columns:
  - Kept columns used in relationships, visuals, slicers, or measures.
  - Marked columns with constant values or not used anywhere as candidates to remove.
- In Power Query:
  - Opened **Transform data**.
  - Selected unwanted columns (e.g. Country in dim_customer, unused helper fields).
  - Used **Remove columns**.
  - Applied changes back to the model.
- Verified:
  - Removed columns no longer appear in Model/Data view.
  - Existing visuals and measures still work.

#### What I learned
- Removing unnecessary columns:
  - Reduces model size and memory usage.
  - Can improve performance (less data to scan).
  - Makes the model simpler to understand.
- Difference with hiding columns:
  - **Hide** = kolom blijft in het model (alleen niet zichtbaar in Fields → geen performance winst).
  - **Remove** = kolom echt weg uit het model → wél performance/memory winst.

### Step 2 – Disable auto date/time (or understand its impact)

#### What I did in Power BI
- Reviewed what Auto date/time does:
  - Power BI automatically creates hidden date tables for each Date/DateTime column.
  - Useful for quick time intelligence, but adds extra tables and model size.
- In the current PBIX file:
  - File → Options and settings → Options → **Current File → Data Load**
  - Turned off **Auto date/time** for this file.
- (Optional) Globally:
  - File → Options → **Global → Data Load**
  - Turned off Auto date/time for new files.

#### What I learned
- Auto date/time:
  - Creates hidden date tables behind each date column.
  - Increases model size and can be confusing when I already have a proper date table.
- With a dedicated `dim_date` marked as a Date table:
  - I don't need Auto date/time.
  - Turning it off simplifies the model and can improve performance.
- On the exam:
  - If I see a question about reducing model size or avoiding duplicate date tables,
    **disabling Auto date/time** is often the right choice (when a proper date table exists).
