### Step 1 – Proper date table

#### What I did in Power BI
- Reviewed **dim_date**:
  - Confirmed one row per calendar date.
  - Checked that `Date` column is type **Date** (no blanks).
  - Verified supporting columns: Year, MonthNumber, MonthName, Quarter.
- Verified coverage for my fact table:
  - All `fact_sales[DateKey]` values exist in `dim_date[DateKey]`.
  - Date range in dim_date fully covers the sales data.
- (Optional) Practiced creating a date table with DAX:
  - Used `CALENDAR` + `ADDCOLUMNS` to generate dates and year/month/quarter fields.

#### What I learned
- A proper **date table**:
  - Has one row per date, with no gaps.
  - Uses a true Date-type column for relationships and time intelligence.
  - Includes helper columns (Year, Month, Quarter, etc.) for grouping.
- Time intelligence functions (YTD, MTD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, etc.) expect
  a dedicated date table, not auto date/time.
- The date table must fully cover the date range used in fact tables.

### Step 2 – Mark date table as "Date table"

#### What I did in Power BI
- Verified that `dim_date[Date]`:
  - Is of data type **Date**.
  - Has one unique value per row (no blanks, no duplicates).
- In **Model view**:
  - Selected the `dim_date` table.
  - Used **Table tools → Mark as date table**.
  - Chose the `Date` column as the date column.
- Confirmed that `dim_date` is now marked as the official Date table for the model.

#### What I learned
- Power BI needs a dedicated **marked date table** for DAX time intelligence functions to work correctly.
- The date column used to mark the table must:
  - Be of type **Date**.
  - Contain unique values (one row per date, no blanks).
- Once marked, functions like YTD, MTD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR will reference this table.

### Step 3 – Time intelligence measures (YTD, MTD, Same period last year)

#### What I did in Power BI
- Created `Total Sales` as base measure:
  - `Total Sales = SUM( fact_sales[SalesAmount] )`
- Created YTD measure:

  `Total Sales YTD =
  TOTALYTD(
      [Total Sales],
      dim_date[Date]
  )`

- Created MTD measure:

  `Total Sales MTD =
  TOTALMTD(
      [Total Sales],
      dim_date[Date]
  )`

- Created same period last year measure:

  `Total Sales Same Period LY =
  CALCULATE(
      [Total Sales],
      SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR( dim_date[Date] )
  )`

- Tested these measures in:
  - Table/matrix with Date or YearMonth on rows.
  - Line chart comparing YTD vs Same Period Last Year.
  - Slicers on Year, Customer, Store to see how results change with filters.

#### What I learned
- Time intelligence functions require:
  - A dedicated, marked **date table** (dim_date).
  - A continuous Date column used in relationships.
- `TOTALYTD` / `TOTALMTD`:
  - Aggregate a base measure from the start of the year/month to the current date.
- `SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR`:
  - Shifts the current date context back by one year to compare periods.
- Typical pattern:
  - Base measure (`Total Sales`) → wrap with YTD/MTD/LY functions for time-based analysis.
