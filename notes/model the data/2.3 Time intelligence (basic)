### Step 1 – Proper date table

#### What I did in Power BI
- Reviewed **dim_date**:
  - Confirmed one row per calendar date.
  - Checked that `Date` column is type **Date** (no blanks).
  - Verified supporting columns: Year, MonthNumber, MonthName, Quarter.
- Verified coverage for my fact table:
  - All `fact_sales[DateKey]` values exist in `dim_date[DateKey]`.
  - Date range in dim_date fully covers the sales data.
- (Optional) Practiced creating a date table with DAX:
  - Used `CALENDAR` + `ADDCOLUMNS` to generate dates and year/month/quarter fields.

#### What I learned
- A proper **date table**:
  - Has one row per date, with no gaps.
  - Uses a true Date-type column for relationships and time intelligence.
  - Includes helper columns (Year, Month, Quarter, etc.) for grouping.
- Time intelligence functions (YTD, MTD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, etc.) expect
  a dedicated date table, not auto date/time.
- The date table must fully cover the date range used in fact tables.
