### Step 1 – Star schema (fact vs dimension tables)

#### What I did in Power BI
- Opened my model in **Model view**.
- Reviewed each table to decide if it is:
  - A **fact table** (transactional, many rows, contains numeric measures).
  - A **dimension table** (descriptive attributes like Customer, Product, Date, Region).
- Identified my main fact table:
  - `FactSales` (one row per **order line** – this is the grain).
- Identified key dimension tables:
  - `DimCustomer`, `DimProduct`, `DimDate`, `DimStore`, ...
- Arranged the model visually as a **star**:
  - Fact table in the center.
  - Dimension tables around it like star points.

#### What I learned
- A **fact table** stores events/transactions at a specific grain (e.g. one row per order line).
- A **dimension table** stores descriptive attributes used to filter, group, and slice facts.
- A **star schema** = one central fact table with multiple dimension tables directly connected to it.
- Star schemas are:
  - Easier for users to understand.
  - Better for performance and simpler DAX than complex/snowflake models.
- Clearly defining the **grain** of the fact table is important to avoid confusion in measures.

### Step 2 – Identify keys for relationships

#### What I did in Power BI
- Loaded the CSV files:
  - DimCustomer, DimProduct, DimStore, DimDate, FactSales.
- In Power Query, turned on:
  - Column quality
  - Column distribution
  - Column profile
  - Profiling based on **Entire data**.
- Checked primary keys in dimension tables:
  - `DimCustomer[CustomerID]` → unique, no nulls.
  - `DimProduct[ProductID]` → unique, no nulls.
  - `DimStore[StoreID]` → unique, no nulls.
  - `DimDate[DateKey]` → unique, no nulls.
- Checked keys in the fact table:
  - `FactSales[SalesID]` → unique → primary key of the fact table.
  - `FactSales[CustomerID]`, `[ProductID]`, `[StoreID]`, `[DateKey]`:
    - Many repeated values, no nulls → good foreign keys.
- Created a conceptual mapping:
  - DimCustomer[CustomerID] → FactSales[CustomerID]
  - DimProduct[ProductID] → FactSales[ProductID]
  - DimStore[StoreID] → FactSales[StoreID]
  - DimDate[DateKey] → FactSales[DateKey]

#### What I learned
- A **primary key** uniquely identifies each row in a table and should have no null values.
- In a star schema, dimension tables usually provide the primary keys used in relationships.
- A **foreign key** is a column in another table that refers to a primary key.
- In the fact table:
  - Foreign keys can repeat many times (one customer/product appears in many sales).
  - A separate surrogate key (SalesID) can be used as the fact table's primary key.
- Clearly identifying primary and foreign keys makes it easier to create correct relationships in the model.
