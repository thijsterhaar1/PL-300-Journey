### Step 1 – Star schema (fact vs dimension tables)

#### What I did in Power BI
- Opened my model in **Model view**.
- Reviewed each table to decide if it is:
  - A **fact table** (transactional, many rows, contains numeric measures).
  - A **dimension table** (descriptive attributes like Customer, Product, Date, Region).
- Identified my main fact table:
  - `FactSales` (one row per **order line** – this is the grain).
- Identified key dimension tables:
  - `DimCustomer`, `DimProduct`, `DimDate`, `DimStore`, ...
- Arranged the model visually as a **star**:
  - Fact table in the center.
  - Dimension tables around it like star points.

#### What I learned
- A **fact table** stores events/transactions at a specific grain (e.g. one row per order line).
- A **dimension table** stores descriptive attributes used to filter, group, and slice facts.
- A **star schema** = one central fact table with multiple dimension tables directly connected to it.
- Star schemas are:
  - Easier for users to understand.
  - Better for performance and simpler DAX than complex/snowflake models.
- Clearly defining the **grain** of the fact table is important to avoid confusion in measures.
