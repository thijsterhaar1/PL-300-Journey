### Step 1 – Calculated column vs measure

#### What I did in Power BI
- Created a **calculated column** in fact_sales:

  `SalesAmount Calc Column = fact_sales[Quantity] * fact_sales[UnitPrice]`

  - Value stored per row in the table.
  - Does not change when I filter the report.

- Created a **measure**:

  `Total Sales = SUM(fact_sales[SalesAmount])`

  - Used the measure in a table visual with CustomerName.
  - Saw that the measure result changes depending on filters and slicers.

#### What I learned
- **Calculated column**
  - Evaluated when the data is loaded/refreshes.
  - Stores a value **per row** in the table.
  - Increases model size because values are saved.
  - Useful when I need the value as:
    - A grouping/slicer/axis
    - Part of relationships or row-level security.

- **Measure**
  - Not stored in the table; calculated **on the fly**.
  - Uses the current **filter context** (what the user has filtered).
  - Ideal for aggregations (SUM, AVERAGE, counts, ratios).
  - Best for KPIs and numbers shown in visuals.

- Rule of thumb:
  - If I need a value per row (for grouping, filtering, or relationships) → **calculated column**.
  - If I just need a number in visuals that should react to filters → **measure**.
