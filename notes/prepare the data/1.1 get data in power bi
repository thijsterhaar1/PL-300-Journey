# get data in power bi – notes

---

### Step 1 - Excel connection
- Connected to sales.xlsx via Get data > Excel.
- Checked and fixed data types in Power Query.

---

### Step 2 - CSV connection
- Created and imported customers.csv via Get data > Text/CSV.
- Adjusted data types in Power Query.

---

### Step 3 – Combining multiple sources in one model

#### What I did
- Loaded `sales.xlsx` from Excel as table **sales**.
- Loaded `customers.csv` as table **customers_pl300**.
- Created a relationship:
  - customers_pl300[Region] (1-side)
  - sales[Region] (*-side)
  - Cross filter direction: Both
  - Relationship is active.
- Built a bar/column chart:
  - X-axis: **customers_pl300[Region]**
  - Y-axis: **Sum of sales[Quantity]**

#### What I noticed & fixed
- At first, every bar showed **6** (the total Quantity), no matter the region.
- This happened because there was **no active relationship** between the tables, so the Region filter didn’t reach the sales table.
- After creating the proper relationship, each region now shows its **own** Sum of Quantity.

#### What I learned
- Power BI can combine data from different sources (Excel + CSV) in one model using relationships.
- Without a relationship, filters on one table don’t affect measures from another table.
- A correct one-to-many relationship is essential for accurate visuals.

### Step 4 – Relational data sources (SQL Server)

#### What I read
- Relational data sources are databases like SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, etc.
- In Power BI I can connect to them using:
  - Server name
  - (Optional) database name
  - Credentials / authentication
- After connecting, I can select tables or write queries to load data.

#### What I did in Power BI
- Opened Get data > SQL Server in Power BI Desktop.
- Looked at the SQL Server connection dialog:
  - Server
  - Database (optional)
  - Data connectivity mode: Import or DirectQuery.
- (No real database yet, just explored the dialog.)

#### What I learned
- Relational sources are structured tables with relationships.
- Power BI connects to them via the SQL Server connector.
- I now know where to choose Import vs DirectQuery when connecting.

### Step 5 – Storage mode: Import vs DirectQuery

#### What I read
- Power BI can use different storage modes when connecting to data sources:
  - **Import**: data is copied into the Power BI model (.pbix file).
  - **DirectQuery**: data stays in the source and Power BI queries it live.
- The storage mode is selected in the connector dialog (e.g. SQL Server) under **Data connectivity mode**.

#### What I did in Power BI
- Opened **Get data > SQL Server** in Power BI Desktop.
- Looked at the **Data connectivity mode** options:
  - Import
  - DirectQuery
- (Optional if true) Connected to a database using Import mode and loaded one table.

#### What I learned (in my own words)
- **Import** mode:
  - Copies the data into the .pbix file.
  - Usually faster and supports more DAX and modeling features.
  - Needs a refresh to see new data.
- **DirectQuery** mode:
  - Leaves the data in the source (e.g. SQL Server).
  - Each interaction sends a query to the source.
  - Better for very large or near real-time datasets.
  - Has more limitations and depends on the performance of the source.
- For most “normal” Power BI reports, **Import** is the default/best choice.
- For huge or real-time datasets, **DirectQuery** can be useful, but comes with trade-offs.
