### Step 1.3 – Profile data

#### What I did in Power Query
- Turned on profiling in View:
  - Column quality
  - Column distribution
  - Column profile
  - Set profiling to **Entire data**.
- Used **Column quality** to see valid/empty/error percentages per column.
- Used **Column distribution/profile** on numeric columns to:
  - View min, max, average and histogram.
  - Spot potential outliers (very high or low values).
- Checked for duplicates on key columns using:
  - Distinct vs unique counts in the profile.
  - **Keep duplicates** (then removed that step again).

#### What I learned
- Column quality quickly shows missing values and errors.
- Column distribution/profile helps me see the shape of the data and outliers.
- Distinct vs unique counts help detect duplicate keys.
- Profiling is a fast way to understand overall data quality before modeling.
