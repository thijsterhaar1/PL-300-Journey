# PL-300 Objectives Checklist

This checklist is based on the main skills measured in the PL-300 exam.  
Use it to track what you’ve really *mastered*, not just watched once 😉

- [ ] Understand DirectQuery vs Import mode (high-level)
- [ ] Combine data from multiple sources into one model

### 1.2 Clean, transform and load data (Power Query)

- [ ] Change column data types
- [ ] Filter rows (remove blanks, remove errors, etc.)
- [ ] Split columns (by delimiter, by number of characters)
- [ ] Merge columns
- [ ] Remove and rename columns
- [ ] Use “Use first row as headers”
- [ ] Handle nulls and errors (replace/remove)
- [ ] Sort data
- [ ] Create conditional columns
- [ ] Merge queries (join tables)
- [ ] Append queries (stack tables)
- [ ] Understand query steps and how to edit/delete them
- [ ] Load data to the model (Close & Apply)

### 1.3 Profile data

- [ ] Use column quality, distribution, and profile in Power Query
- [ ] Identify outliers or strange values
- [ ] Check for duplicates
- [ ] Understand basic data quality issues (missing values, inconsistent formats)

---

## 2. Model the data

### 2.1 Design and build a model

- [ ] Understand star schema (fact vs dimension tables)
- [ ] Identify keys (primary/foreign) for relationships
- [ ] Create relationships between tables
- [ ] Understand relationship cardinality (1:*, *:*)
- [ ] Understand cross filter direction (single, both)
- [ ] Hide technical columns from report view
- [ ] Organize fields into display folders (optional but nice)

### 2.2 DAX – calculated columns & measures

- [ ] Know the difference between:
  - [ ] Calculated column
  - [ ] Measure
- [ ] Create basic calculated columns
- [ ] Create basic measures:
  - [ ] `SUM`
  - [ ] `COUNT` / `COUNTROWS`
  - [ ] `AVERAGE`
- [ ] Use `CALCULATE` to change filter context
- [ ] Use `FILTER` in a measure
- [ ] Use `RELATED` / `RELATEDTABLE`
- [ ] Understand row context vs filter context (in simple terms)

### 2.3 Time intelligence (basic)

- [ ] Have a proper date table in the model
- [ ] Mark date table as “Date table”
- [ ] Create measures like:
  - [ ] Year-to-Date (YTD)
  - [ ] Month-to-Date (MTD)
  - [ ] Same period last year
- [ ] Build visuals comparing this year vs last year

### 2.4 Optimize the model

- [ ] Remove unnecessary columns
- [ ] Disable auto-date/time (or understand its impact)
- [ ] Understand basics of model performance (high level)

## 3. Visualize and analyze the data

### 3.1 Create reports and visuals

- [ ] Add and format:
  - [ ] Bar/Column charts
  - [ ] Line charts
  - [ ] Tables
  - [ ] Matrix
  - [ ] Cards / KPIs
  - [ ] Pie/Donut charts (and when NOT to overuse them)
- [ ] Use slicers (single-select, multi-select)
- [ ] Use filters:
  - [ ] Visual-level filters
  - [ ] Page-level filters
  - [ ] Report-level filters
- [ ] Use drilldown and expand in visuals

### 3.2 Interactivity & navigation

- [ ] Create drillthrough pages
- [ ] Add tooltips for extra info
- [ ] Use bookmarks for custom views
- [ ] Add buttons for navigation (home/back/report sections)
- [ ] Build a simple multi-page report that feels like a small app

### 3.3 Format & make it readable

- [ ] Use consistent colors and fonts
- [ ] Rename visuals and fields so they are clear to the user
- [ ] Use conditional formatting (e.g. color by value)
- [ ] Sort by other columns when needed (e.g. months in correct order)
- [ ] Add titles, labels, and descriptions where needed

### 3.4 Analyze data

- [ ] Use “Analyze” features (Explain increase/decrease, where available)
- [ ] Add quick measures (high-level understanding)
- [ ] Answer concrete business questions with your report
  (e.g. best customers, worst region, trend over time)

## 4. Manage and secure Power BI

### 4.1 Work with Power BI Service

- [ ] Publish a report from Power BI Desktop to Power BI Service
- [ ] Understand:
  - [ ] Workspaces
  - [ ] Datasets
  - [ ] Reports
  - [ ] Dashboards
  - [ ] Apps (high-level)
- [ ] Pin visuals to a dashboard
- [ ] Refresh a dataset manually

### 4.2 Data refresh & gateways

- [ ] Understand scheduled refresh (daily, hourly, etc.)
- [ ] Know what a gateway is (on-premises data)
- [ ] Know when you need a gateway (high-level concept)

### 4.3 Row-Level Security (RLS)

- [ ] Create roles in Power BI Desktop
- [ ] Define DAX filters for RLS (e.g. `[Region] = "West"`)
- [ ] Test roles with “View as role”
- [ ] Publish with RLS and assign users to roles in the Service

### 4.4 Sharing & permissions

- [ ] Share a report/dashboard with a specific user (high level)
- [ ] Know the difference between:
  - [ ] Viewer vs Member vs Contributor in a workspace (conceptually)
- [ ] Understand basic licensing concepts (Pro vs Free – very high level)

## 5. Exam readiness

- [ ] I have read the official PL-300 skills outline at least once
- [ ] I have done at least one full practice assessment
- [ ] I reviewed every wrong answer and know *why* it was wrong
- [ ] I built at least 2–3 small end-to-end projects in Power BI (from data to report)
- [ ] I am comfortable navigating the exam UI (question types, mark for review, etc.)
- [ ] I can explain my model and reports as if I’m talking to a manager

When most of these items are checked, you’re probably very close to being ready for the exam 💪
