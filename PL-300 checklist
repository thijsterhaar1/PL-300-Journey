# PL-300 Objectives Checklist

This checklist is based on the main skills measured in the PL-300 exam.  
Use it to track what you’ve really *mastered*, not just watched once 😉

## Overall Progress

- [X] I can load data into Power BI and clean it on my own
- [ ] I can build a proper data model with relationships and DAX measures
- [ ] I can create clear, interactive reports that answer business questions
- [ ] I understand the basics of Power BI Service, sharing, and security
- [ ] I feel ready to do a full practice exam without looking things up

## Project milestones & timing

Use these milestones to decide **when** to build (or upgrade) a project.  
Rough idea: after 1–2 study sessions on a topic → do a small project.

- [X] **Mini Project 1 – Data Cleaning**
  - Target timing: after you’ve done basic *Prepare the data* modules.
  - Build a small report from a single Excel/CSV source.
  - Use Power Query to clean data (remove columns, fix data types, filter rows).

- [ ] **Project 2 – Sales Model v1**
  - Target timing: after you’ve learned basic relationships and simple DAX.
  - Create a model with multiple tables (e.g. Sales, Customers, Products).
  - Add basic measures (`SUM`, `COUNT`, simple `CALCULATE`) and a few core visuals.

- [ ] **Project 3 – Sales Dashboard v2 (Insights)**
  - Target timing: after you’ve covered *Visualize & analyze the data* basics.
  - Take Project 2 and upgrade it:
    - Add slicers, drillthrough, tooltips, cards/KPIs.
    - Focus on answering concrete questions (best month, best customer, etc.).

- [ ] **Project 4 – Alternative Scenario Report**
  - Target timing: after you’re comfortable with several visuals and filters.
  - Use a different dataset (customers, marketing, operations… anything).
  - Focus on variety: matrix, line charts, conditional formatting, sorting, etc.

- [ ] **Project 5 – Published Report with RLS**
  - Target timing: after you’ve studied *Manage & secure Power BI*.
  - Publish one of your existing projects to Power BI Service.
  - Set up Row-Level Security (RLS) and test with “View as role”.

- [X] Filter rows (remove blanks, remove errors, etc.)
- [X] Split columns (by delimiter, by number of characters)
- [X] Merge columns
- [X] Remove and rename columns
- [X] Use “Use first row as headers”
- [X] Handle nulls and errors (replace/remove)

- [X] Create conditional columns
- [X] Merge queries (join tables)
- [X] Append queries (stack tables)
- [X] Understand query steps and how to edit/delete them
- [X] Load data to the model (Close & Apply)

### 1.3 Profile data

- [X] Use column quality, distribution, and profile in Power Query
- [X] Identify outliers or strange values
- [X] Check for duplicates
- [X] Understand basic data quality issues (missing values, inconsistent formats)

---

## 2. Model the data

### 2.1 Design and build a model

- [X] Understand star schema (fact vs dimension tables)
- [X] Identify keys (primary/foreign) for relationships
- [X] Create relationships between tables
- [X] Understand relationship cardinality (1:*, *:*)
- [X] Understand cross filter direction (single, both)
- [ ] Hide technical columns from report view
- [ ] Organize fields into display folders (optional but nice)

### 2.2 DAX – calculated columns & measures

- [ ] Know the difference between:
  - [ ] Calculated column
  - [ ] Measure
- [ ] Create basic calculated columns
- [ ] Create basic measures:
  - [ ] `SUM`
  - [ ] `COUNT` / `COUNTROWS`
  - [ ] `AVERAGE`
- [ ] Use `CALCULATE` to change filter context
- [ ] Use `FILTER` in a measure
- [ ] Use `RELATED` / `RELATEDTABLE`
- [ ] Understand row context vs filter context (in simple terms)

### 2.3 Time intelligence (basic)

- [ ] Have a proper date table in the model
- [ ] Mark date table as “Date table”
- [ ] Create measures like:
  - [ ] Year-to-Date (YTD)
  - [ ] Month-to-Date (MTD)
  - [ ] Same period last year
- [ ] Build visuals comparing this year vs last year

### 2.4 Optimize the model

- [ ] Remove unnecessary columns
- [ ] Disable auto-date/time (or understand its impact)
- [ ] Understand basics of model performance (high level)

## 3. Visualize and analyze the data

### 3.1 Create reports and visuals

- [ ] Add and format:
  - [ ] Bar/Column charts
  - [ ] Line charts
  - [ ] Tables
  - [ ] Matrix
  - [ ] Cards / KPIs
  - [ ] Pie/Donut charts (and when NOT to overuse them)
- [ ] Use slicers (single-select, multi-select)
- [ ] Use filters:
  - [ ] Visual-level filters
  - [ ] Page-level filters
  - [ ] Report-level filters
- [ ] Use drilldown and expand in visuals

### 3.2 Interactivity & navigation
